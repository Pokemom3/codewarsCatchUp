// You are given a number and have to make it negative.
// But maybe the number is already negative?
//PLAN:
//Loop through numbers
//See if the number is negative or not
//If number is negative do nothing and return existing number
//Go to next number
// If number is positive, convert it to negative (*-1)
//return new negative number
//return new array.
